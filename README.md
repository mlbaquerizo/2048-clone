#A 2048 Clone

## Summary

This is my implementation of the game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) by Gabriele Cirulli.

My version is built in JavaScript using the JQuery, Underscore.js, and Mousetrap.js libraries.

## Learning Competencies

* Build a JavaScript interface independent of a backend.
* Build a complex JS model independent of the interface.
* Integrate the JS model with the HTML interface.
* Use the Mousetrap.js library to bind keyboard events.

## Future

* Add sliding animations for a better user experience.
* Save game state.
* Use quirky images instead of numbers.
